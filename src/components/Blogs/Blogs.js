          fast user interfaces for websites and applications alike. The main
          concept of React. js is virtual DOM.How does ReactJS work behind the
          scenes? Image result for how does react work React goes through its

          2. What is the difference between State and Props in React?
        </h1>

        <p className="my-3 text-xl m-3 text-orange-800 ">
          Props are used to pass data from one component to another. The state
          is a local data storage that is local to the component only and cannot
          be passed to other components. The "this.setState" property is used to
          update the state values in the component.

          3. What does useEffect do other than data loading?
        </h1>

        <p className="my-3 text-xl m-3 text-orange-800  ">
          The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your
          components useEffect() hook runs the side-effect after initial
          rendering, and on later renderings only if the name value changes.You
          can have multiple useEffects in your code and this is completely fine!
           Multiple hooks rule also applies to useState - you can have multiple useState in one component to separate different part of the state, you don't have to build one complicated state object
